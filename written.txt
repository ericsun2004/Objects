Objects Assignment

1, Freezing an object means that the information an
objects holds will no longer be susceptible to 
alteration, addition, or other forms of change. In
a frozen object, no new values may be introduced, 
and current values can not change. 

A reason to freeze an object is if an object holds 
important information that one do not wish to change,
but may accidentally be changed by a program. Therefore,
as a safety precaution, the object should be frozen.

2, To pass parameters into a function using object 
destructuring, one would need to put the name of the
keys of an object into curly brackets, and pass that
function in. 

For example: 

let africanStripedPolecat = {
	
	name: "striped polecat",
	location: "africa",
	hobby: "striped poles",

}

function whatIs({name, location, hobby}) {

	console.log(name, location, hobby);

}

whatIs (africanStripedPolecat);

Using destructuring to access values in objects,
one would avoid the hard labour of repetatively
retrieving such selfsame values using individual codes.
